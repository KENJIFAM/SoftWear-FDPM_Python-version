# Fashion Design Process Management
Metropolia software engineering school project done by Team SoftWear. Fashion Design Process Management (FDPM) is an application to aid and streamline fashion design process and to have all the information in one place and available everywhere.
FDPM is a web application running in the browser and backend is handled by Java-based application server GlassFish5.
# To run this application:
* Have a server able to run GlassFish
* Load the project files into a new empty Java EE project in your favourite IDE
* Create a persistence unit for the database connection (persistence.xml)
* Persistence unit should be placed and named as FDPM-SERVER > src > conf > persistence.xml
* After this, build the application and deploy to the server
* The WEB folder contains the website and needs to be deployed
* Enjoy!
